# HomeEx Helper

HomeEx Helper is a react-based application that serves to provide a platform through which physical therapists can better manage the home exercise programs of patients. Therapists can sign-up by providing the necessary information and details of their licensure and credentials as a physical therapist. They are then given a unique identifier (which, at the moment, is merely their id in the database) that they can share with their patients that upon patient signup, can be used to create the association between therapist and patients. Once the relationship is established, therapists will be allowed to deploy exercises for their patients by providing descriptions and video links that will serve as guides for their patients. Once logged in, patients can then see the newly deployed exercises and interact with each exercise by raising concerns and "flagging" certain exercises and asking questions in the comments section of each exercise.
